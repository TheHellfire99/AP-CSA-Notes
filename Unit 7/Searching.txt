- linear searching fits a standard for loop perfectly!
Â  - specify each element one at a time 
  - do not need to track the index after exeution.
  - retrive thhe value at the specified index and compare it to the searched value 

- linear search algorithms check each element in order until tthe desired value is found or al elements in the arrray 
  or arrayList have been checked. 

-  cannot use enhanced for loop for selection sort.
