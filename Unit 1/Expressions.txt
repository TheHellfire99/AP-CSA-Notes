- literal: The source code representation of a fixed value. 
  - is a numeric value 
  - example: 3 or 4 or 5

- string literal: encapsulated in double quotes 
  - is an string value 
  - example: "3"

- Arithmaitc operators:- 
  - add: + 
  - subtract: - 
  - multiply: *
  - divide: /
  - modulus: % (provides the remainder of the division)
    - 17%5 = 2 

- if we do operations that involve a specific data type, 
  our answers will be in that data type. 
  - example: 
    - int * int = int 
    - double * double = double

- if we do operations involving 2 or more data types, 
  highest data type will be used to the answers
  - example: 
    - int * double = double 

- Java follows order of operations (PEMDAS)

- 8*6-14%3+8/2 = 50 

- in java, if you divide by zero. the compiler throws an arithmaitc exception

- the Assignment operator: = 
  - assign a value to a variable 
  - example: x = 7; 
  - cannot say 7 = x; we can only go one direction

- can also take x = y = z = 7; 
  - take the value of the variable to the right and assign it to the left one. 
    so we assign value of y to x.
