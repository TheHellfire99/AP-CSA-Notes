- Compound Assignment Operators:- 
  - += 
    - example x+=7 
    - add 7 to the value stored in x

  - -=
    - example x -= 7 
    - subtract 7 from the value stored in x and store it back in x

  - x*= , x/= , x%= 
    - does the same things as mentioned above but in their own operations (multiply, divide, modulus)
    - x *= 7 , x /= 7 , x %= 7 

- compound assinment operators can be used instead of assignment operators

- increment operator: ++ 
  - example: x++
  - add one

- decrement operator: --
  - example: x--
  - subtract one
