- casting: temporarily change one data type to another data type
  - change int to double temporarily etc 
  - example:-
    - System.out.println((double) 6/4); 
      - prints out double value 

- can also round numbers using casting operators. 
  - example:- 
    - int rounded = (int)(number + 0.5);  (for rounding positive values)
    - int rounded = (int)(number - 0.5);  ( for negative values)

- casting to int just drops the decimal value. 

- data types are limited to how much info they can store
  - int can store -2147483648 to 2147483647
    - Intger.MAX_VALUE 
    - Intger.MIN_VALUE 

  - double can store up to 14-15 digits 

- if the data is bigger than max value or min value, then the compiler will throw error

- integer overflow occurs if you try to print value of max value + 1. it turns to negaitve min value. Same thing for 
  negative but it turns to positive max value
