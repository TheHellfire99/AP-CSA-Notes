- primitive data: determines the size and type of information
  
  - Booleans: true/false values 
    - only takes 1 bit and is the smallest data type

  - int: integer values which are whole numbers 
    - 32 bits 

  - double: decimal numbers also known as floating point numbers 
    - 64 bits 

  - String: text values such as "hello world"
   - 16 bits 

- Primitive types are already part of the java langauge 

- Non-primitive types are created by the programmer 
  - can use methods to perform actions unlike primitive types which can't

- Variable: A name given to a memory location that is holding a value

- Variable is used to store data which can be used later in the code 

- adding a final to the data types makes the value a constant meaning it isn't going to change 
  - example:- 
    - final int PENIS = 10; 
    - variable name of final is always all caps
