 - 2D arrays are stored as arrays of arrays. 
   - created and index similar as 1D objecs

- initializer array used to create and initialize 2D array consists of initializer lists that 
  represent 1D arrays 

- to declare a 2D array : DataType[][] name 
  - int[][] grades

- to initialize a 2D array : new DataTyp[r][c]
  - new int[7][4]

- to use initializer array: {{1,2,3,4},{5,6,7,8}}; 

- to find out number of arrays : r = arrayName.length; 
  - numer of columns is based off number of elements in row
    - c = grades[0].length

- to access specific element in a 2D array : arrayName[r][c]
  - grades[5][2]

- to change value at specific element : arrayName[r][c]=value; 

- we use nested loops to traverse 2D arrays
