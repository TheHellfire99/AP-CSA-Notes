- math class methods are static
  - static methods are those that belong to the class rather than objects of a class.

- math class methods are predefined, return numeric value, and act upon the given parameters. 
  - predefined means class libraries

- math class methods don't require instance variable creation. 

- Math class is part of java.lang.Math

- static int abs(int x) : returns the absolute value of an int value 
  - static int num = Math.abs(-100); 

- static double abs(double x) : return the absolute value of a double value
  - static double num = Math.abs(-200.420); 

- static double pow(double base, double exponent) : returns value of base raised to the power of exponent
  - static double num = Math.pow(2.2, 69.23); (can also use an int)

- static double sqrt(double x) : returns the positive square root of a double value
  - static double num = Math.sqrt(645.3); (can also use an int)

- static double random() : return random double between 0 and 1. 
  - static double num = Math.random(); (can also be an int) . 

- casting is used to convert double to int. 
  - example:- ((int)(Math.random()); 
  - adding (int) before the number turns it into an integer. 
  - can also use (double) in the same way 

- ((int)(Math.random()* 100 + 1))
  - creates random number between 0-100 (inclusive)

- to create inclusive random values of between a certian range. do the following
  - (int) (Math.random()*(range + 1 ) * lowest value allowed)
