- Enhanced For loop:- 
  - only two part to the header and they are seperatd by a colon. 

- first half of enhanced for loop signature is the type and name of the variable 
  and the colon seperates the variable section from the variable being transversed.

- example:
  For(type declaration : structure){
      //code
  }

  for (int number : values){
      System.out.println(number)
  }
