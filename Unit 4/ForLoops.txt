- There are 3 parts to a for loop:- 
  - Initialization, Boolean Expression, and increment. (the increment can also be a decrement)

- for loop syntax:- 
  for(Initialization; boolean expression; update;){
      //code
  }

- you can write for loop as a while loop. (upto the programmer)

- in for loops, the increment statement runs after the entire loop body is executed and before the 
  boolean value is evaluated again
