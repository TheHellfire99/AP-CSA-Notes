- Nested Iterations : Iteration statments inside the body of another interation statement 

- inner loop must complete entire Iteration before outerloop can run
  - example: a clock acts like a nested loop

- inner loop controls what prints on each line and outer loop controls how many times 

- just like for loops, you can have while loops inside while loops
