- in loops, boolean expressions are evaluated before each iteration of the loop body including the first.
  - when expression evaluates to true, the loop body is executed until the expression evaluates to false 

- loop : repetition of statements. (while, for, and do-while)

- while loop syntax:- 
  - use a loop control variable for the loop 

  //initialize loop control variable 
  while (/*check loop control variable*/){
      //code
      //update loop control variable 
  }

- your code is evaluated based on where it is placed. 
  - it iterates through each line going down
